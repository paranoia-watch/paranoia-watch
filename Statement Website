Terrorism threatens our societies. The fear of terrorism even more. At times when the free world is wounded to the core, we are inundated with headlines, news and talk shows. When we are threatened, information is crucial, but an overload is extremely dangerous because of the fear it generates. After all, is this not exactly what terrorists aim for? Is it not precisely this paranoia, this abundance of attention to headlines, news and tweets that takes us hostage and thus benefits the terrorist?

Between 2001 and 2011 the international homeland security industry exploded, from 10 billion to 100 billion euros per year. Governments use the fear of terrorism to implement policies that restrict civil rights. More and more, citizens are willing to give up privacy for a fancied sense of security. How is this all affecting the societies that we live in?

Paranoia.watch monitors the fear of terrorism in capital cities, where the population density is high and the potential impact for terrorist attacks is immense. Starting with Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris, we have the ambition to become a leading global indicator. Also, commercial and political exploitation will be examined on the basis of comparative data.
