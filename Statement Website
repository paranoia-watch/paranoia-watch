Terrorism threatens our societies. The fear of terrorism even more. At times when the free world is wounded to the core, we are inundated with headlines, news and talk shows. When we are threatened, information is crucial, but an overload is extremely dangerous because of the fear it generates. After all, is this not exactly what terrorists aim for? Is it not precisely this paranoia, this abundance of attention to headlines, news and tweets that takes us hostage and thus benefits the terrorist?
